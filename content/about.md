Hi! My name is Daniel, and I have over 5 years of experience as a Back-End developer, working with languages like Python, Go, and JavaScript. I specialize in writing and refactoring code, building RESTful APIs, and building modern, robust Web Applications and microservices. Before transitioning to Back-End development, I focused on Front-End development using React-based frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby.

In my free time I like to build tools for self-consumption like [marastatic](/projects/marastatic.html), a single-file static site generator that I also used to build this site; [housaku](/projects/housaku.html), a personal search engine based on SQLite and its FTS capabilities; and [lazyfeed](/projects/lazyfeed.html), an RSS feed reader for the terminal with support for in-app view.

Outside of coding, I have a passion for learning languages. Fluent in Spanish (my mother tongue) and English, I can also hold basic conversations in Italian and German. Currently, I am learning French and Japanese.
